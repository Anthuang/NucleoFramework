## Overview
Framework in Mathematica for communication with other platforms for robotic applications.

The goal is to provide a platform where the user can perform both control and data analysis together.

Please read the [documentation file](https://github.com/Anthuang/NucleoFramework/blob/master/SerialDocumentation.pdf) for more information.

## Purpose
We aim to provide a platform where the user can perform tasks, control, and data analysis together. This platform will be a better environment for researchers and programmers alike to interact with robots.

## Current Functionality
* Serial communication
* Simple GUI and graphing
